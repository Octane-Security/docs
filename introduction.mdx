## Vulnerability Detection

Octane's detectors search for issues in your source code. We use cutting-edge machine learning to find vulnerabilities, filtering out the noise and showing you the niche issues that really matter.

## Code Fix Engine

Octane's Code Fix Engine is built from the ground up to fix vulnerabilities in Solidity smart contracts. Once an issue is identified, Octane's Code Fix engine spins up automatically to draft a fix. This can massively cut down on the time it takes to fix a vulnerability, and can even be used to fix vulnerabilities, whether identified by Octane or human auditors.

## Compliance Engine

Understanding how your smart contracts stack up to industry security best practices is vitally important, especially as smart contracts become more complex and the specter of regulation looms. Octane's Compliance Engine lets you measure how your smart contracts stack up to the EthTrust standard, showing what you need to fix, and even suggesting these fixes in order to get compliant.

## Attack Simulation on Mainnet Fork

Octane uses a highly optimized fuzzer to spin up simulated attackers and benign users of your smart contracts, all on a fork of mainnet. No setup necessary, attackers use a set of standard objectives, and can be supercharged with platform-specific invariants/objectives.
