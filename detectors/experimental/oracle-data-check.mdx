title: Missing/Improper Check on Oracle Data
---

When fetching data from an external source, the contract must carefully check params of the received data, including the updatedAt and roundId parameters, to make sure that data returned from the Oracle is fresh and authentic. Without these checks, any error or downtime in the oracle can cause stale data throughout the protocol.

Octane will detect and flag whenever a contract fetches data from an oracle without checking necessary parameters for freshness and authenticity.
